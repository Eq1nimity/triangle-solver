# Triangle Solver

A set of calculators to solve triangles based on given information.

Law of sines theory documentation is written in Jupyter [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Eq1nimity/triangle-solver/blob/master/Law-of-Sines.ipynb).

## How it works

Set of separate python scripts that do a single function.

1) Run python scripts
2) Follow prompts

## How would theoretically works (if implemented)

Given a set of sufficient partial information, the calculator will either:
* Solve the remaining parts of a the triangle
* Determine and solve the two triangles.
* Determine there is no solvable triangle.
